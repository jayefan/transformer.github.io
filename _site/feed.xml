<p>This research means to discover the power of transformer in dealing with time series data, for instance traffic flow. Transformer with multihead self-attention mechanism is well-suited for the task like traffic prediction as it can weight the importance of various aspects in the traffic data sequence, capturing both long-term dependencies and short-term patterns. Compared to the LSTM, the transformer owns the power of parallelization, which is more efficient when facing a large dataset. And it can capture the dependencies better with long sequences. However, the transformer may have trouble dealing with the long sequence time-series data due to the heavy computation. This research compares differnt methods that make use of the information redundancy and their combination from the perspective of computational efficiency and prediction accuracy.</p>

<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>The time series data processing and prediction are usually conducted with RNN and LSTM. In the case of traffic prediction, CNN and GNN are combined for efficiently capturing spatial and temporal information. And LSTM is widely used as its better performance on capturing temporal dependencies. While recent studies have propsed to replace RNNs with Transformer architecture as it is more efficient and able to capture sequantial dependencies. However, the model is inapplicable when facing long sequence time-series data due to quadratic time complexity, high memory usage, and inherent limitation of the encoder-decoder architecture. <d-cite key="Zhou_Zhang_Peng_Zhang_Li_Xiong_Zhang_2021"></d-cite></p>

<p>Not all time series are predictable, the ones that is feasible to be better forecasted should contain cyclic or periodic patterns. <d-cite key="Zeng_Chen_Zhang_Xu_2023"></d-cite> It indicates that there are redundant information in the long sequence data. The coundary of the redundancy can be measured by the optimal masking ratio of using MAE to process the dataset. Natural images are more information-redundant than languages and thus the optimal masking ratio is higher. BERT<d-cite key="devlin2019bert"></d-cite> uses a masking ratio of 15% for language, MAE<d-cite key="He_2022_CVPR"></d-cite> uses 75% for image and the optimal ratio for video is up to 90%.<d-cite key="feichtenhofer2022masked"></d-cite> Traffic data is potentially redundant. It contains temporal and spatial information so that neighbor sensors can provide extra information in addition to temporal consistency. We inducted that the optimal ratio for traffic data should be located between image and video. As it has multidimensional information than image and the speed captured by sensors is not as consistent as the frames in videos. We use the GRIN<d-cite key="cini2022filling"></d-cite> model to mask the inputdata using Metr_LA dataset to test the redundancy of traffic data. The results show that it is tolerant when the masking ratio is lower than 90%. Then there is the possibility of using distilling operation to compress information, reducing computational requirement and memory usage. Similar to traffic data, most of the time series data are multivariate.</p>

<p>(table)</p>
<h2 id="methodology">Methodology</h2>
<p>The information redundancy leads to the common solutions of using transformer to deal with long sequence time-series forecasting(LSTF) problems, where models focus more on valuable datapoints to extract time-series features. Notable models are focsing on the less explored and challenging long-term time series forecasting(LTSF) problem, include Log- Trans, Informer, Autoformer, Pyraformer, Triformer and the recent FEDformer. <d-cite key="Zeng_Chen_Zhang_Xu_2023"></d-cite> There are several main solutions:</p>

<p>Data decomposition. Data decomposition refers to the process of breakking down a complex dataset into simpler, manageable components. Autoformer <d-cite key="wu2021autoformer"></d-cite> first applies seasonal-trend decomposition behind each neural block, which is a standard method in time series analysis to make raw data more predictable <d-cite key="cleveland1990stl"></d-cite>. Specifically, they use a moving average kernel on the input sequence to extract the trend-cyclical component of the time series. The difference between the original sequence and the trend component is regarded as the seasonal component. <d-cite key="Zeng_Chen_Zhang_Xu_2023"></d-cite></p>

<p>Learning time trend. Positional embeddings are widely used in transformer architecture to capture spatial information. <d-cite key="feichtenhofer2022masked"></d-cite> Moreover, additional position embeddings can help the model to understand the periodicity inherented in traffic data, which implies applying the relative or global positioin encoding interms of weeks and days. <d-cite key="https://doi.org/10.1111/tgis.12644"></d-cite></p>

<p>Distillation. The Informer model applies ProbSparse self-attention mechanism to let each key to only attend to several dominant queries and then use the distilling operation to deal with the redundance. The operation privileges the superior ones with dominaitng features and make a focused self-attention feature map in the next layer, which trims the input’s time dimension.<d-cite key="Zhou_Zhang_Peng_Zhang_Li_Xiong_Zhang_2021"></d-cite></p>

<p>Patching. As proposed in ViT<d-cite key="DBLP:journals/corr/abs-2010-11929"></d-cite>, the patch embeddings are small segments of an input image, which transfer the 2D image to 1D sequence. Each patch contains partial information of the image and additional positional embedding helps the transformer to understand the order of a series of patch embeddings. In the case of time series, though it is 1D sequence that can be received by standard transformer, the self-attention may not efficiently capture the long dependencies and cause heavy computation. Hence, dealing with time-series data, patching is used to understand the temporal correlation between data in a time-step interval. Unlike point-wise input tokens, it enhances the locality and captures the comprehensive semantic information in different time steps by aggregating times steps into subseries-level patches. <d-cite key="nie2023time"></d-cite></p>

<h2 id="experiment">Experiment</h2>
<!-- ### Dataset -->
<p>We used a multivariate traffic<d-footnote>https://pems.dot.ca.gov/</d-footnote> dataset that records the road occupancy rates from different sensors on San Francisco freeways. We selected first 100 censors as our experiment dataset.</p>

<!-- ### Experimental Settings -->
<p>We choose two models, Informer<d-cite key="Zhou_Zhang_Peng_Zhang_Li_Xiong_Zhang_2021"></d-cite>  and PatchTST<d-cite key="nie2023time"></d-cite> to test the influence of distillation, positional embeddings, patching and data decomposition. For the implementation of Informer and PatchTST, we used the code provided by the authors.<d-footnote>https://github.com/yuqinie98/patchtst</d-footnote>. We mean to compare different methods that aim to efficiently explore on long sequence data, considering both efficiency and accuracy. This leads to a discussion about the trade off when using these models to solve real life cases and the possibility of improving or combing different methods.</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Compare efficieny and accuracy of distillation and patching. All the models are following the same setup, using 10 epochs and batch size 12 with input length [96,192,336,720] and predictioin length [96,192,336,720]. The performance and cost time is listed in the table 2.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Explore the influence of data decomposition and distillation. We slightly change the setup of two models to compare different methods. We apply the data decomposition with PatchTST and deactive the self-attention distilling mechanism in Informer to explore the significance of these techniques.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<h2 id="result">Result</h2>

<h2 id="conclusion-and-discussion">Conclusion and Discussion</h2>
<p>In addition to applying transformer architecture alone, a combination of various methods or framework may help us to benefit from the advantages of different models. The transformer-based framwork for multivariate time series representation lerning is proposed by George et al.  <d-cite key="DBLP:journals/corr/abs-2010-02803"></d-cite> The Spatial-Temporal Graph Neural Networks(STGNNs) is another widely used model in traffic prediction, which only consider short-term data. The STEP model is propsde to enhance STGNN with a scalable time series pre-training mode. In the pre-training stage. They split very long-term time series into segments and feed them into TSFormer, which is trained via the masked autoencoding strategy. And then in the forecasting stage. They enhance the downstream STGNN based on the segment-level representations of the pre-trained TSFormer.<d-cite key="10.1145/3534678.3539396"></d-cite></p>

<!-- ## Citations

Citations are then used in the article body with the `<d-cite>` tag.
The key attribute is a reference to the id provided in the bibliography.
The key attribute can take multiple ids, separated by commas.

The citation is presented inline like this: <d-cite key="gregor2015draw"></d-cite> (a number that displays more information on hover).
If you have an appendix, a bibliography is automatically created and populated in it.

Distill chose a numerical inline citation style to improve readability of citation dense articles and because many of the benefits of longer citations are obviated by displaying more information on hover.
However, we consider it good style to mention author last names if you discuss something at length and it fits into the flow well — the authors are human and it’s nice for them to have the community associate them with their work.

## Code Blocks

This theme implements a built-in Jekyll feature, the use of Rouge, for syntax highlighting.
It supports more than 100 languages.
This example is in C++.
All you have to do is wrap your code in a liquid tag:


{% highlight c++ linenos %}  <br/> code code code <br/> {% endhighlight %}


The keyword `linenos` triggers display of line numbers. You can try toggling it on or off yourself below:


<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-c--" data-lang="c++"><span class="kt">int</span> <span class="nf">main</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="kt">int</span> <span class="n">argc</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="kt">char</span> <span class="k">const</span> <span class="err">\</span><span class="o">*</span><span class="n">argv</span><span class="p">[])</span>

<!-- ## Layouts

The main text column is referred to as the body.
It is the assumed layout of any direct descendants of the `d-article` element.

<div class="fake-img l-body">
  <p>.l-body</p>
</div>

For images you want to display a little larger, try `.l-page`:

<div class="fake-img l-page">
  <p>.l-page</p>
</div>

All of these have an outset variant if you want to poke out from the body text a little bit.
For instance:

<div class="fake-img l-body-outset">
  <p>.l-body-outset</p>
</div>

<div class="fake-img l-page-outset">
  <p>.l-page-outset</p>
</div>

Occasionally you’ll want to use the full browser width.
For this, use `.l-screen`.
You can also inset the element a little from the edge of the browser by using the inset variant.

<div class="fake-img l-screen">
  <p>.l-screen</p>
</div>
<div class="fake-img l-screen-inset">
  <p>.l-screen-inset</p>
</div>

The final layout is for marginalia, asides, and footnotes.
It does not interrupt the normal flow of `.l-body` sized text except on mobile screen sizes.

<div class="fake-img l-gutter">
  <p>.l-gutter</p>
</div> -->

## Other Typography?

Emphasis, aka italics, with *asterisks* (`*asterisks*`) or _underscores_ (`_underscores_`).

Strong emphasis, aka bold, with **asterisks** or __underscores__.

Combined emphasis with **asterisks and _underscores_**.

Strikethrough uses two tildes. ~~Scratch this.~~

1. First ordered list item
2. Another item
⋅⋅* Unordered sub-list. 
1. Actual numbers don't matter, just that it's a number
⋅⋅1. Ordered sub-list
4. And another item.

⋅⋅⋅You can have properly indented paragraphs within list items. Notice the blank line above, and the leading spaces (at least one, but we'll use three here to also align the raw Markdown).

⋅⋅⋅To have a line break without a paragraph, you will need to use two trailing spaces.⋅⋅
⋅⋅⋅Note that this line is separate, but within the same paragraph.⋅⋅
⋅⋅⋅(This is contrary to the typical GFM line break behaviour, where trailing spaces are not required.)

* Unordered list can use asterisks
- Or minuses
+ Or pluses

Inline `code` has `back-ticks around` it.

```javascript
var s = "JavaScript syntax highlighting";
alert(s);
```
 
```python
s = "Python syntax highlighting"
print s
```
 
```
No language indicated, so no syntax highlighting. 
But let's throw in a <b>tag</b>.
```

Colons can be used to align columns.

| Tables        | Are           | Cool  |
| ------------- |:-------------:| -----:|
| col 3 is      | right-aligned | $1600 |
| col 2 is      | centered      |   $12 |
| zebra stripes | are neat      |    $1 |

There must be at least 3 dashes separating each header cell.
The outer pipes (|) are optional, and you don't need to make the 
raw Markdown line up prettily. You can also use inline Markdown.

Markdown | Less | Pretty
--- | --- | ---
*Still* | `renders` | **nicely**
1 | 2 | 3

> Blockquotes are very handy in email to emulate reply text.
> This line is part of the same quote.

Quote break.

> This is a very long line that will still be quoted properly when it wraps. Oh boy let's keep writing to make sure this is long enough to actually wrap for everyone. Oh, you can *put* **Markdown** into a blockquote. 


Here's a line for us to start with.

This line is separated from the one above by two newlines, so it will be a *separate paragraph*.

This line is also a separate paragraph, but...
This line is only separated by a single newline, so it's a separate line in the *same paragraph*. -->]]></content><author><name></name></author></entry><entry><title type="html">Sample Blog Post</title><link href="http://0.0.0.0:8080/staging/blog/2022/distill-example/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Sample Blog Post" /><published>2022-12-01T00:00:00-06:00</published><updated>2022-12-01T00:00:00-06:00</updated><id>http://0.0.0.0:8080/staging/blog/2022/distill-example</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://0.0.0.0:8080/staging/blog/2022/distill-example/"><![CDATA[<h2 id="equations">Equations</h2>

<p>This theme supports rendering beautiful math in inline and display modes using <a href="https://www.mathjax.org/">MathJax 3</a> engine.
You just need to surround your math expression with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">$$</code>, like <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">$$ E = mc^2 $$</code>.
If you leave it inside a paragraph, it will produce an inline expression, just like \(E = mc^2\).</p>

<p>To use display mode, again surround your expression with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">$$</code> and place it as a separate paragraph.
Here is an example:</p>

\[\left( \sum_{k=1}^n a_k b_k \right)^2 \leq \left( \sum_{k=1}^n a_k^2 \right) \left( \sum_{k=1}^n b_k^2 \right)\]

<p>Note that MathJax 3 is <a href="https://docs.mathjax.org/en/latest/upgrading/whats-new-3.0.html">a major re-write of MathJax</a> that brought a significant improvement to the loading and rendering speed, which is now <a href="http://www.intmath.com/cg5/katex-mathjax-comparison.php">on par with KaTeX</a>.</p>

<h2 id="images-and-figures">Images and Figures</h2>

<p>Its generally a better idea to avoid linking to images hosted elsewhere - links can break and you
might face losing important information in your blog post.
To include images in your submission in this way, you must do something like the following:</p>

<div class="language-markdown highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>{% include figure.html path="assets/img/2022-12-01-distill-example/iclr.png" class="img-fluid" %}
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>which results in the following image:</p>

<figure>

</figure>

<p>To ensure that there are no namespace conflicts, you must save your asset to your unique directory
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/assets/img/2023-05-01-[SUBMISSION NAME]</code> within your submission.</p>

<p>Please avoid using the direct markdown method of embedding images; they may not be properly resized.

<h3 id="interactive-figures">Interactive Figures</h3>

<p>Here’s how you could embed interactive figures that have been exported as HTML files.
Note that we will be using plotly for this demo, but anything built off of HTML should work
(<strong>no extra javascript is allowed!</strong>).
All that’s required is for you to export your figure into HTML format, and make sure that the file
exists in the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">assets/html/[SUBMISSION NAME]/</code> directory in this repository’s root directory.
To embed it into any page, simply insert the following code anywhere into your page.</p>

<div class="language-markdown highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>{% include [FIGURE_NAME].html %} 
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>For example, the following code can be used to generate the figure underneath it.</p>

<div class="language-python highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="kn">import</span> <span class="nn">pandas</span> <span class="k">as</span> <span class="n">pd</span>

</code></pre></div></div>

<p>And then include it with the following:</p>

<div class="language-html highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nt">&lt;div</span> <span class="na">class=</span><span class="s">"l-page"</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>
  <span class="nt">&lt;iframe</span> <span class="na">src=</span><span class="s">"{{ 'assets/html/2022-12-01-distill-example/plotly_demo_1.html' | relative_url }}"</span> <span class="na">frameborder=</span><span class="s">'0'</span> <span class="na">scrolling=</span><span class="s">'no'</span> <span class="na">height=</span><span class="s">"600px"</span> <span class="na">width=</span><span class="s">"100%"</span><span class="nt">&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;</span>
<span class="nt">&lt;/div&gt;</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Voila!</p>

<div class="l-page">
  <iframe src="/staging/assets/html/2022-12-01-distill-example/plotly_demo_1.html" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" height="600px" width="100%"></iframe>
</div>

<h2 id="citations">Citations</h2>

<p>Citations are then used in the article body with the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&lt;d-cite&gt;</code> tag.
The key attribute is a reference to the id provided in the bibliography.
The key attribute can take multiple ids, separated by commas.</p>

<p>The citation is presented inline like this: <d-cite key="gregor2015draw"></d-cite> (a number that displays more information on hover).
If you have an appendix, a bibliography is automatically created and populated in it.</p>

<p>Distill chose a numerical inline citation style to improve readability of citation dense articles and because many of the benefits of longer citations are obviated by displaying more information on hover.
However, we consider it good style to mention author last names if you discuss something at length and it fits into the flow well — the authors are human and it’s nice for them to have the community associate them with their work.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="footnotes">Footnotes</h2>

<p>Just wrap the text you would like to show up in a footnote in a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&lt;d-footnote&gt;</code> tag.
The number of the footnote will be automatically generated.<d-footnote>This will become a hoverable footnote.</d-footnote></p>

<hr />

<h2 id="code-blocks">Code Blocks</h2>

<p>This theme implements a built-in Jekyll feature, the use of Rouge, for syntax highlighting.
It supports more than 100 languages.
This example is in C++.
All you have to do is wrap your code in a liquid tag:</p>

<p>{% highlight c++ linenos %}  <br /> code code code <br /> {% endhighlight %}</p>

<p>The keyword <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">linenos</code> triggers display of line numbers. You can try toggling it on or off yourself below:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-c--" data-lang="c++"><span class="kt">int</span> <span class="nf">main</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="kt">int</span> <span class="n">argc</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="kt">char</span> <span class="k">const</span> <span class="err">\</span><span class="o">*</span><span class="n">argv</span><span class="p">[])</span>

<h2 id="diagrams">Diagrams</h2>

<p>This theme supports generating various diagrams from a text description using <a href="https://github.com/zhustec/jekyll-diagrams" target="\_blank">jekyll-diagrams</a> plugin.
Below, we generate a few examples of such diagrams using languages such as <a href="https://mermaid-js.github.io/mermaid/" target="\_blank">mermaid</a>, <a href="https://plantuml.com/" target="\_blank">plantuml</a>, <a href="https://vega.github.io/vega-lite/" target="\_blank">vega-lite</a>, etc.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> different diagram-generation packages require external dependencies to be installed on your machine.
Also, be mindful of that because of diagram generation the fist time you build your Jekyll website after adding new diagrams will be SLOW.
For any other details, please refer to <a href="https://github.com/zhustec/jekyll-diagrams" target="\_blank">jekyll-diagrams</a> README.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> This is not supported for local rendering!</p>

<p>The diagram below was generated by the following code:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>{% mermaid %}
sequenceDiagram
    participant John
    participant Alice
    Alice-&gt;&gt;John: Hello John, how are you?
    John--&gt;&gt;Alice: Great!
{% endmermaid %}

<h2 id="layouts">Layouts</h2>

<p>The main text column is referred to as the body.
It is the assumed layout of any direct descendants of the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">d-article</code> element.</p>

<div class="fake-img l-body">
  <p>.l-body</p>
</div>

<p>For images you want to display a little larger, try <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.l-page</code>:</p>

<div class="fake-img l-page">
  <p>.l-page</p>
</div>

<p>All of these have an outset variant if you want to poke out from the body text a little bit.
For instance:</p>

<div class="fake-img l-body-outset">
  <p>.l-body-outset</p>
</div>

<div class="fake-img l-page-outset">
  <p>.l-page-outset</p>
</div>

<p>Occasionally you’ll want to use the full browser width.
For this, use <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.l-screen</code>.
You can also inset the element a little from the edge of the browser by using the inset variant.</p>

<div class="fake-img l-screen">
  <p>.l-screen</p>
</div>
<div class="fake-img l-screen-inset">
  <p>.l-screen-inset</p>
</div>

<p>The final layout is for marginalia, asides, and footnotes.
It does not interrupt the normal flow of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.l-body</code> sized text except on mobile screen sizes.</p>

<div class="fake-img l-gutter">
  <p>.l-gutter</p>
</div>

<p>Emphasis, aka italics, with <em>asterisks</em> (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">*asterisks*</code>) or <em>underscores</em> (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">_underscores_</code>).</p>

<p>Strong emphasis, aka bold, with <strong>asterisks</strong> or <strong>underscores</strong>.</p>

<p>Combined emphasis with <strong>asterisks and <em>underscores</em></strong>.</p>

<p>Strikethrough uses two tildes. <del>Scratch this.</del></p>

<ol>
  <li>First ordered list item</li>
  <li>Another item
⋅⋅* Unordered sub-list.</li>
  <li>Actual numbers don’t matter, just that it’s a number
⋅⋅1. Ordered sub-list</li>
  <li>And another item.</li>
</ol>

<p>⋅⋅⋅You can have properly indented paragraphs within list items. Notice the blank line above, and the leading spaces (at least one, but we’ll use three here to also align the raw Markdown).</p>

<p>⋅⋅⋅To have a line break without a paragraph, you will need to use two trailing spaces.⋅⋅
⋅⋅⋅Note that this line is separate, but within the same paragraph.⋅⋅
⋅⋅⋅(This is contrary to the typical GFM line break behaviour, where trailing spaces are not required.)</p>

<ul>
  <li>Unordered list can use asterisks</li>
  <li>Or minuses</li>
  <li>Or pluses</li>
</ul>

<p>There must be at least 3 dashes separating each header cell.
The outer pipes (|) are optional, and you don’t need to make the 
raw Markdown line up prettily. You can also use inline Markdown.</p>
